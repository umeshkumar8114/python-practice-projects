# Tortoise vs Hare Race Simulation

A fun command-line Python simulation of the classic race between the Tortoise and the Hare.

### Features:
- Simulates a 50-space race with realistic probabilistic movement
- Movement logic follows specific odds for both animals
- Displays track progress at each second of the race
- Includes biting behavior (`"OW!!"`) when they collide
- Tortoise wins ties as per rules

### Run it:
```bash
python3 race_simulation.py
```
