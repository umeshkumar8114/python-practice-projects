# Python Practice Projects

This repository is a curated collection of Python projects demonstrating foundational programming concepts, command-line interactivity, and object-oriented design.

The projects are organized into themed folders based on their focus and functionality.

## üìÅ Structure

### `python-playground/`
A collection of small scripts showcasing:
- String manipulation
- File I/O
- Encoding/decoding text
- Simple user input and formatting

### `python-oop-concepts/`
Projects built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles:
- Class design
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Modular design with separate logic and driver scripts

### `rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/`
A command-line game that expands on traditional rock-paper-scissors with added logic and verbs:
- Uses data structures and game state tracking
- Includes user input validation and scoring

### `tortoise-vs-hare-race/`
A simulation of the Tortoise vs Hare race:
- Random movement based on probabilities
- Graphical output using terminal characters
- Includes collision detection and race summary

---

Each folder contains its own `README.md` with additional details.

## üìå How to Run

All scripts are terminal-based and can be run using:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
