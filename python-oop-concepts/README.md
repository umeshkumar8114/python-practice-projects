# Python OOP Concepts

This folder contains Python scripts that demonstrate foundational object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts including:

- Class and object creation
- Inheritance and method overriding
- Encapsulation and abstraction
- Use of constructors and class attributes

Each script is self-contained and illustrates a specific concept in OOP.

Scripts will be added below as they are included.### `pet_class.py`
Defines a `Pet` class with private attributes and setter/getter methods. Includes a main function for creating and updating a pet object via user input.

### `retail_items.py`
Defines a `Retail_Items` class with formatted output using `__str__`. The program accepts user input for two items and displays them in a neat tabular format.### Trivia Game (`trivia_class.py`, `questions.py`, `trivia_game.py`)
A modular trivia game built using object-oriented principles. It consists of:

- `trivia_class.py`: Defines a `Trivia` class to encapsulate each question, its options, and the correct answer.
- `questions.py`: A module that generates and returns a list of `Trivia` objects representing multiple-choice questions.
- `trivia_game.py`: The driver program that hosts a two-player trivia match. Players alternate answering questions, and the game displays scores and the winner at the end.

Includes user input handling, alternating turns, and printed question formatting.
